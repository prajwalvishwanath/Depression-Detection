# Depression-Detection
Final Year Project

Childhood anxiety and depression often go undiagnosed. If left untreated these conditions, collectively known as internalizing disorders, are associated with long-term negative outcomes including substance abuse and increased risk for suicide. This project presents a new approach for identifying young children with internalizing disorders using a 3-minute speech task.
We have planned to implement machine learning analysis of audio data from the task can be used to identify children with an internalizing disorder. The speech features most discriminative of internalizing disorder are analyzed in detail, showing that affected children exhibit especially low pitch voices, with repeatable speech inflections and content, and high-pitched response to surprising stimuli relative to controls.
